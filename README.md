# obsidian-markmap.nvim

markmap  ü§ù obsidian.nvim

This is an example optional plugin that extends obsidian.nvim's capability, similar to the idea of `community plugins`.

**TODO**:

- [ ] preview note.
- [ ] generate a tmp markdown file that describe the vault with links, then preview it, similar to graph view.
