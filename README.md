# obsidian-markmap.nvim

This is an example optional plugin that extends obsidian.nvim's capability, similar to the idea of `community plugins`.

**TODO**:

- [x] auto install `markmap` through `npm`
- [x] preview note.
- [x] register command into `obsidian.nvim`'s cmdline completion and menu.
- [ ] generate a tmp markdown file that describe the vault with links, then preview it, similar to graph view.
